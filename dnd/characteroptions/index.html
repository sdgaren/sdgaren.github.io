				Materials for Stevie

			<p class="text"><span class="emphasis">Stevie:</span> For your first session, please bring the following materials:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>3-ring binder</li>
				<li>Notepad</li>
				<li>Pencil and eraser</li>
				<li>Optional: 7-piece polyhedral dice, such as <a class="inline" href="https://www.amazon.com/Chessex-Manufacturing-Cube-Gemini-Dice/dp/B00OU6INMM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1521315263&sr=8-3&keywords=chessex">this set from Chessex</a>. These are available in every color combination you can imagine online or at places like <a class="inline" href="http://www.ggportland.com">Guardian Games</a>. I also have plenty of spare sets to borrow.</li>
			</ul>	
			<p class="text">We will also need to build a character for you to play. Please choose a character class from the list of remaining character classes below and let me know which you prefer so I may print up materials for you. Next session, we will work together for a few minutes to fully build out the character based on the class you choose, including selecting your character's race and abilities. Don't worry about choosing a class that appears complex - we will teach you the game as we play and other newcomers like Courtney are doing very well playing complex classes. Please also consider your character's name and a loose idea of what their backstory might be. Don't hestitate to let me know if you have questions, either!</p>

			<p class="name">Barbarian</p>
			<p class="text">Barbarians are the most "tank-like" of the martial classes, able to both deal and absorb more physical damage than other classes. Barbarians fling themselves into a battle rage to deal and absorb additional damage in combat. Barbarians tend to be highly combat-focused, with limited skills and nearly no magic.</p>

			<p class="name">Bard</p>
			<p class="text">Bards are a jack-of-all-trades class focused upon magic and supporting other team members by "buffing" their attacks or defense. Bards choose to either focus upon magic and lore, in which case they often represent the group in social situations, or they choose to take a more martial approach and are more of swashbucklers. If you choose a bard, please let me know if you prefer a social bard or a more combative one.</p>

			<p class="name">Cleric</p>
			<p class="text">Clerics are both potent spellcasters and highly-effective in combat. Although they are not as skilled in either as more focused characters, their flexibility makes them a strong class. Clerics also possess the most powerful healing and buffing spells of any class. They also tend to be charismatic and often make strong party leaders.</p>

			<p class="name">Druid</p>
			<p class="text">Druids are nature-based spellcasters that possess the ability to shapechange into animals. This makes druids particularly dangerous to enemies, as they can transform from a powerful spellcaster to a ferocious animal at will.</p>

			<p class="name">Ranger</p>
			<p class="text">Rangers exist in the space between Fighters and Druids - deadly hunters that survive in the wilds. Rangers tend to be particularly skilled at combat with a longbow, but can also mix it up in one-on-one combat. Rangers also have an animal companion such as a mastiff, a wolf, a panther, or similar, which can assist them in combat and with tracking and survival.</p>

			<p class="name">Sorcerer</p>
			<p class="text">Unlike Wizards, who have a huge breadth of spells at their disposal, Sorcerers have comparatively few. What they get in exchange is immense flexibility in how that magic is cast and used. Sorcerers are arguaby the best spellcasters for combat and tend to be highly charismatic, mysterious individuals well-suited to acting as party leaders.</p>

			<p class="name">Warlock</p>
			<p class="text">Warlocks are the most "unusual" spellcasters in the game, having obtained their magic from a mysterious patron - a demigod, a legendary creature from before the mortal races were born, or a demon from the nine hells - which imposes a pact upon the warlock in exchange for a grant of power. Warlocks are often driven by compulsions only they understand, seen by their peers as "crazy" or "bizarre". Their magic is unpredictable and they may gain a number of strange, superhuman powers such as the ability to confuse other minds, disappear, or see in the dark.</p>
