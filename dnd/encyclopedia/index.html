			<ul>
				<li>Discovered by Deige Stonewall, Duff, Esmerelda, Hooligan, and Noda on the other side of a portal opened by the sigil sequence.</li>
				<li>Perhaps 100 feet in length and appearing to be made of gold, the scarab's purpose and significance remains unknown.</li>
				<li>Appears to have greatly perturbed Zohar.</li>
				<li>Zohar and Has&#807met believe the golden scarab may predate The Great Cataclysm.</li>
				<li>Under active investigation by Astra, Zohar, and Has&#807met at a makeshift research center in Baldur's Gate.</li>

			<p class="name">Jewel of Flame</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Stolen from the possession of Michael Covelli by Deige Stonewall, Duff, Esmerelda, Hooligan, and Sekmet Nzinga as part of a bargain with Kairon.</li>
				<li>Formerly stored in the most secure vault in Michael Covelli's casino, within a piercing light that withers anything it touches.</li>
				<li>Formerly kept in a small box not black in color, but with the appearance of <i>nothing</i>. Touching the box with the jewel inside gave Duff a feeling of immense dread. The box itself does not have this power once the jewel is removed.</li>
				<li>Has the appearance of swirling orange and red flame licking across the surface.</li>
				<li>Provided to Kairon, who intimates that Dagon is the intended recipient.</li>
				<li>Appears to have been kept from Dagon by Michael Covelli. Kairon suggests that Michael Covelli may be attempting to toy with Dagon or extract some advantage from him through this, a choice Kairon believes dangerous and foolish.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<div id="sigilsequence" class="anchor"></div>
			<p class="name">Sigil Sequence</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A sequence of eleven sigils, organized as a portal key.</li>
				<li>Stolen from Candlekeep Monastery by agents of TransWorld Acquisition Technologies on behalf of the Covelli Crime Family, apparently at Dagon's request.</li>
				<li>Provided to Vinnie the Halfling, who was intended to fence it to Iarno, but instead sold it to Gundren Rockseeker.</li>
				<li>Sold to Gundren as a "map to the lost mine of Nashkel", prompting Gundren to hire Duff, Esmerelda, Noda, and Hooligan to assist in delivering mining supplies to Nashkel at the beginning of our story.</li>
				<li>Deige Stonewall engaged to track down sigil sequence on behalf of Candlekeep once the theft is discovered.</li>
				<li>Deige believes the map may have celestial connections.</li>
				<li>Esmerelda recognizes that although all known sigil sequences have the same ninth, tenth, and eleventh runes, this sequence has a unique ninth rune.</li>
				<li>Opens a portal to a hypostyle hall containing the golden scarab.</li>
				<li>The paper the sigil sequence is printed on appears to be very ancient.</li>

			<div id="zoharsbook" class="anchor"></div>
			<p class="name">Zohar's Book</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Claims to have been written by Zohar.</li>
				<li>Appears to be very ancient.</li>
				<li>Stolen from Candlekeep Monastery by agents of TransWorld Acquisition Technologies under contract from the Covelli Crime Family, apparently at Dagon's order.</li>
				<li>Ordered destroyed by Dagon.</li>
				<li>First page preserved by Kairon, which reads:</li>
				<p class="blockquote" style="margin-top: 10px;">I, Zohar, once called the Regent of Calimshan and Empress of the known lands east of the Trackless Sea, do commit now to these pages the last testament of the world in the days before the Great Cataclysm that befell it, the last memories of the bargain I made, and how in my weakness I failed the world and caused all its wonders to be destroyed. Even now as I write these words, my recollection of these last days fades, torn from my mind by the lengths to which I went to cowardly avoid the consequences of my actions. To whomever finds and reads these words, I beg of you to trust not he who calls himself Dagon, for behind his fair words is the utmost of malevolence.</p>
				<li>The sigil sequence was ripped from its pages.</li>
