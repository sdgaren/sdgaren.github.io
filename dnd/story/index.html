			<p class="text">In the great city of Baldur’s Gate, Esmerelda, Noda, Duff, and Hooligan find their separate ways to a tavern in a forgotten back alley advertising a job opportunity. They are introduced to the dwarf Gundren who has the proposal. He implies he has “found something big” in the mining village of Nashkel, a 6-day journey south into the mountains, and offers 25 gold each for the four to escort a wagonload of supplies there. He asks them to set off first thing in the morning and departs south that afternoon on a pony.</p>
			<p class="text">On the second-to-last day of the journey, our heroes find Gundren’s pony, slain by black arrows. The adventurers dispatch a goblin ambush, then follow drag marks into the woods in search of Gundren. They follow the drag marks along the bank of a stream for perhaps a mile before they discover a cave with two goblins guarding. One guard is killed and the other is captured, has dynamite strapped to him, and then is tied to a tree. Exploring the cave, our heroes discover Gundren beaten and unconscious at the hands of a hobgoblin. The hobgoblin and his entourage are quickly defeated, but the map remains elusive. Exploring further, the group discovers a 7-foot tall sewn-together patchwork humanoid who calls himself Klarg  in possession of the map. A quick bit of thinking by Esmerelda liberates the map by way of her Mage Hand spell, but a battle ensues wherein Noda removes one of Klarg’s arms and Duff leaves him unconscious. On the way out the door, Noda attempts to earn a pet out of Klarg’s wolf, but is violently rejected.</p>
			<p class="text">Examining the crates and boxes in Klarg’s cavern, the group spots the same logo as on the crates they were intended to deliver. Becoming suspicious of Gundren, they interrogate him, where, grateful for the rescue, he reveals that a number of previous shipments have been intercepted on the way to Nashkel. Our heroes conclude that someone else must know of the map, and using Klarg and his band of goblins, has been attempting to capture it for themselves.</p>

			<p class="text">Gundren leads our heroes to an inn at Nashkel where they meet Gundren’s older brothers Tharden and Nundro. Gundren’s brothers reveal the map, which appears unlike any map either our adventurers or their dwarven patrons have ever seen. Gundren’s brothers are immediately skeptical and accuse Gundren of falling victim to another scam from a halfling named Vinnie, who apparently has a habit of selling Gundren objects purported to be powerful but are useless or dangerous. Tharden, fed up with Gundren’s gullibility, tosses the map to Esmerelda and the three dwarves leave back toward the coast road. Esmerelda immediately recognizes the map as a sigil sequence to a teleportation circle, but with a unique ninth rune.</p>
			<p class="text">Our heroes are awoken to a shadow departing their room at the inn, and Esmerelda immediately notices the map missing from her pack. The group springs into action and finds a group of grey-robed thieves absconding with the map. A fight ensues, but our heroes are unable to stop the thieves. A dwarven paladin staying in the same room assists our heroes. He reveals his name as Deige Stonewall, and appears to know something about the map. Our heroes are deeply skeptical of Deige’s sudden appearance and the fact that he is clearing hiding how much he knows, but it appears they are allies, at least for the moment. Deige joins our group and together they track the thieves to the back door of a nearby storefront.</p>
			<p class="text">Inside, the group pursues the map down a staircase into a large, hastily-constructed underground laboratory. Esmerelda identifies brewing inside some modification of Potions of Healing, but their precise nature is unclear until the group encounters four animated skeletons that appear soaked in these potions. The adventurers sneak through the lab, discovering more patched-together Klarg-like creatures and accidentally setting off a large explosion due to Noda knocking over a table of chemicals. Deep inside, the heroes discover a pompous, grey-skinned elf with the map in his possession, opening a teleportation circle. The elf identifies himself as the “famous” wizard The Black Spider, and calls in one of his creations, a gigantic sewn-together creature named Patchwork to dispatch our heroes. In the fight, The Black Spider is badly hurt, and abandoning his plan for the moment, disappears through a gateway. Patchwork, absent his master, leaves the fight as well.</p>
			<p class="text">Our heroes retrieve the map abandoned by The Black Spider and complete the teleportation circle, including the unique ninth sigil. Stepping inside, they find a hypostyle chamber with an enormous golden scarab inside. None of the five have ever seen such a thing, but both Deige and Esmerelda immediately agree on who might know: the archmage Zohar at the university at the Candlekeep monestary. Travelling to Candlekeep, Zohar consults with her high cleric companion Astra, then uses the sigil sequence to open a teleportation circle to the scarab chamber. Zohar immediately returns, pale and visibly shaken, and remarks to our adventurers that what they found should not still exist.</p>
