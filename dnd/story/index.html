			<h2>Session 1</h2>
			<h3>5 October, 2017</h3>
			
			<p class="text">Times are hard in the city of Baldur’s Gate, and in search of work, the elf wizard Esmerelda, the half-orc barbarian Noda, the human monk Duff, and the human rogue Hooligan find their separate ways to a tavern in a forgotten back alley advertising a job opportunity. They are introduced to the dwarf Gundren who has the proposal. While he will not divulge details, he implies he has “found something big” in the mining village of Nashkel, a 6-day journey south into the mountains. He offers 25 gold each for the four to escort a wagonload of supplies to Nashkel, where he promises more work will be waiting. He asks them to set off first thing in the morning and departs south that afternoon on a pony.</p>
			<p class="text">The next morning the group departs south along the coast road toward Nashkel, dragging the cartload of supplies. The days pass uneventfully until the second-to-last day when the group turns onto the side road leading into the mountains toward Nashkel. There, in a place where the woods press close to the road, they find Gundren’s pony, slain by black arrows.</p>
			<p class="text">Before our adventurers have a chance to fully assess the situation, they are ambushed by four goblins. With Duff and Hooligan exercising their stealth skills while Esmerelda and Noda attack from the front, the ambush is quickly dispatched.</p>
			<p class="text">Surveying the aftermath, the group finds an empty map case smelling of Gundren’s pipe smoke and drag marks and disturbed brush on the left-hand side of the road. Thinking it best to attempt to find out what happened to their patron, they hide the cart and follow the drag marks into the brush. Our adventurers follow the trail for perhaps a mile before they come across a cave with a stream eminating from the mouth. One guard is killed and the other has dynamite from the mining supplies strapped to him before being tied to a tree. The adventurers then sneak into the cave.</p>
			<p class="text">Once inside, they are spotted by a goblin atop a bridge above the cavern, who disappears into the darkness of a side passage and unleashes a wall of water. All but one escape unharmed, but Hooligan, is swept back, soaked and battered. The adventurers regroup and proceed down a side passage, finding a group of goblins torturing Gundren. A battle ensues, and once nearly defeated, the hobgoblin who seems to be in charge attempts to parlay, but is quickly dispatched. The unconscious Gundren now stabilized, the group finds no sign of the map and leaves to explore more of the cavern.</p>
			<p class="text">Along another side passage the group sneaks up to an illuminated passage and finds another cavern, this one filled with boxes and crates. Also inside are a handful of goblins, a wolf, and what appears to be a 7-foot-tall patchwork humanoid who is busying himself examining the map and congratulating himself on having captured it. The group leans this creature’s name is Klarg. Thinking quickly, Esmerelda casts a spell to snag the map from Klarg’s hands, and suprised, it slips from his grasp and into Esmerelda’s. The group fights off the goblins and Klarg, successfully defeating them. In the fray, Duff rediscovers his commitment to pacifism and leaves Klarg wounded and unconscious, but alive. Noda attempts to earn a pet out of the wolf, but is violently rebuked.</p>
			<p class="text">The group examines the crates and boxes in Klarg’s cavern and spotting the same logo as on the crates they themselves were delivering, become suspicious that Gundren may know more than he is letting on. Gundren is awoken and grateful for the rescue, he confesses that a number of previous shipments of supplies had also been intercepted before reaching Nashkel. The group concludes that someone other than Gundren knows about the map, and that this someone clearly envies it.</p>
