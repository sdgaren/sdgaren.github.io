			<p class="text">In the great city of Baldur’s Gate, Esmerelda, Noda, Duff, and Hooligan find their separate ways to a tavern in a forgotten back alley advertising a job opportunity. They are introduced to the dwarf Gundren who has the proposal. He implies he has “found something big” in the mining village of Nashkel, a 6-day journey south into the mountains, and offers 25 gold each for the four to escort a wagonload of supplies there. He asks them to set off first thing in the morning and departs south that afternoon on a pony.</p>
			<p class="text">On the second-to-last day of the journey, our heroes find Gundren’s pony, slain by black arrows. The adventurers dispatch a goblin ambush, then follow drag marks into the woods in search of Gundren. They follow the drag marks along the bank of a stream for perhaps a mile before they discover a cave with two goblins guarding. One guard is killed and the other is captured, has dynamite strapped to him, and then is tied to a tree. Exploring the cave, our heroes discover Gundren beaten and unconscious at the hands of a hobgoblin. The hobgoblin and his entourage are quickly defeated, but the map remains elusive. Exploring further, the group discovers a 7-foot tall sewn-together patchwork humanoid who calls himself Klarg  in possession of the map. A quick bit of thinking by Esmerelda liberates the map by way of her Mage Hand spell, but a battle ensues wherein Noda removes one of Klarg’s arms and Duff leaves him unconscious. On the way out the door, Noda attempts to earn a pet out of Klarg’s wolf, but is violently rejected.</p>
			<p class="text">Examining the crates and boxes in Klarg’s cavern, the group spots the same logo as on the crates they were intended to deliver. Becoming suspicious of Gundren, they interrogate him, where, grateful for the rescue, he reveals that a number of previous shipments have been intercepted on the way to Nashkel. Our heroes conclude that someone else must know of the map, and using Klarg and his band of goblins, has been attempting to capture it for themselves.</p>

			<p class="text">Gundren leads our heroes to an inn at Nashkel where they meet Gundren’s older brothers Tharden and Nundro. Gundren’s brothers reveal the map, which appears unlike any map either our adventurers or their dwarven patrons have ever seen. Gundren’s brothers are immediately skeptical and accuse Gundren of falling victim to another scam from a halfling named Vinnie, who apparently has a habit of selling Gundren objects purported to be powerful but are useless or dangerous. Tharden, fed up with Gundren’s gullibility, tosses the map to Esmerelda and the three dwarves leave back toward the coast road. Esmerelda immediately recognizes the map as a sigil sequence to a teleportation circle, but with a unique ninth rune.</p>
			<p class="text">Our heroes are awoken to a shadow departing their room at the inn, and Esmerelda immediately notices the map missing from her pack. The group springs into action and finds a group of grey-robed thieves absconding with the map. A fight ensues, but our heroes are unable to stop the thieves. A dwarven paladin staying in the same room assists our heroes. He reveals his name as Deige Stonewall, and appears to know something about the map. Our heroes are deeply skeptical of Deige’s sudden appearance and the fact that he is clearing hiding how much he knows, but it appears they are allies, at least for the moment. Deige joins our group and together they track the thieves to the back door of a nearby storefront.</p>
			<p class="text">Inside, the group pursues the map down a staircase into a large, hastily-constructed underground laboratory. Esmerelda identifies brewing inside some modification of Potions of Healing, but their precise nature is unclear until the group encounters four animated skeletons that appear soaked in these potions. The adventurers sneak through the lab, discovering more patched-together Klarg-like creatures and accidentally setting off a large explosion due to Noda knocking over a table of chemicals. Deep inside, the heroes discover a pompous, grey-skinned elf with the map in his possession, opening a teleportation circle. The elf identifies himself as the “famous” wizard The Black Spider, and calls in one of his creations, a gigantic sewn-together creature named Patchwork to dispatch our heroes. In the fight, The Black Spider is badly hurt, and abandoning his plan for the moment, disappears through a gateway. Patchwork, absent his master, leaves the fight as well.</p>
			<p class="text">Our heroes retrieve the map abandoned by The Black Spider and complete the teleportation circle, including the unique ninth sigil. Stepping inside, they find a hypostyle chamber with an enormous golden scarab inside. None of the five have ever seen such a thing, but both Deige and Esmerelda immediately agree on who might know: the archmage Zohar at the university at the Candlekeep monestary. Travelling to Candlekeep, Zohar consults with her high cleric companion Astra, then uses the sigil sequence to open a teleportation circle to the scarab chamber. Zohar immediately returns, pale and visibly shaken, and remarks to our adventurers that what they found should not still exist.</p>

			<p class="text">Zohar and Astra ask our heroes to accompany them to a convening of a council in Baldur’s Gate to determine what is to be done with the discovery of the scarab. At a hall in the city, upwards of a hundred individuals, clerics, wizards, politicians, and guild leaders, gather in a council lead and discuss the discovery. Zohar reveals that she believes both the scarab and the map to be more than one thousand years old and to date from before something she calls The Great Cataclysm. Ignatio, the head of Duff’s order speaks up and asks that the council destroy the scarab for fear that it could be used as a weapon. Duff is immediately suspicious at Ignatio’s behavior. Zohar, having spent her career studying what little survives from before The Great Cataclysm, speaks impassionately about studying the scarab further and requests the appearance of her former colleague, the wizard Has&#807met. Alastair of Waterdeep, the ancient diviner heading the council, agrees with Zohar and charges our heroes with retrieving him from the Oman’s Isle, where he has retired to conduct his research. Has&#807met has guarded the island from teleportation and a maelstrom surrounding the island prevents approach by ship. However, Baldur’s Gate is currently brimming with experimental airships who will in three days be participating in an airship race. Our heroes depart to the wharf to attempt to secure passage with one of the airship captains.</p>
			<p class="text">At the wharf, our heroes are rebuffed by the airship teams one-by-one, until they encounter Nathan Foulweather, a dwarf of Baldur’s Gate, and his haphazardly-constructed airship <i>The Phoenix</i>. Foulweather is in dire need of a crew and offers to transport the group to Oman’s Isle under the condition that they crew for him in the upcoming race and that they are able to finish ahead of the ship captained by Lord Farringwray. Foulweather explains that be designed Farringwray’s ship <i>The Golden Legacy</i>, but was stiffed on the payment. Foulweather cares not about winning the race or its 100,000 GP prize, only about humiliating Farringwray. <i>The Golden Legacy</i> is powered by an arcane core and is incredibly fast, so Foulweather suggests that our heroes sabotage the arcane core so that the ship will explode with a few cannon blasts once in the race.</p>
			<p class="text">Under the cover of night the night before the race, our heroes sneak into Farringwray’s hangar and encounter <i>The Golden Legacy</i>, which is easily ten times the size of Foulweather’s contraption. They sneak aboard through an open porthole and find the arcane core’s chamber. Inside are two guards, one of whom is killed by Noda and the other knocked unconscious by Duff.  Noda damages the arcane core, leaving it vulnerable to further damage and our group sneaks away.</p>
			<p class="text">The following morning, Astra visits to see our heroes off. She explains that she expects the race to be violent and gives the adventurers some parting gifts to see them through the challenge ahead. Our heroes climb aboard <i>The Phoenix</i> and the race begins, the ships catapuled up into the air and out over the ocean. Two competing airships are immediately damaged and fall into the ocean. <i>The Phoenix</i> encounters another airship, whose crew immediately launches an attack. While Hooligan, Noda, and Deige fight off the boarding crew, Esmerelda and Duff critically damage the other ship’s balloons, sending it falling into the ocean below. <i>The Phoenix</i> and her crew fly upwards into the cloud layer, into an approaching winter storm.</p>
