			<p class="text">In the great city of Baldur’s Gate, Esmerelda, Noda, Duff, and Hooligan find their separate ways to a tavern in a forgotten back alley advertising a job opportunity. They are introduced to the dwarf Gundren who has the proposal. He implies he has “found something big” in the mining village of Nashkel, a 6-day journey south into the mountains, and offers 25 gold each for the four to escort a wagonload of supplies there. He asks them to set off first thing in the morning and departs south that afternoon on a pony.</p>
			<p class="text">On the second-to-last day of the journey, our heroes find Gundren’s pony, slain by black arrows. The adventurers dispatch a goblin ambush, then follow drag marks into the woods in search of Gundren. They follow the drag marks along the bank of a stream for perhaps a mile before they discover a cave with two goblins guarding. One guard is killed and the other is captured, has dynamite strapped to him, and then is tied to a tree. Exploring the cave, our heroes discover Gundren beaten and unconscious at the hands of a hobgoblin. The hobgoblin and his entourage are quickly defeated, but the map remains elusive. Exploring further, the group discovers a 7-foot tall sewn-together patchwork humanoid who calls himself Klarg  in possession of the map. A quick bit of thinking by Esmerelda liberates the map by way of her Mage Hand spell, but a battle ensues wherein Noda removes one of Klarg’s arms and Duff leaves him unconscious. On the way out the door, Noda attempts to earn a pet out of Klarg’s wolf, but is violently rejected.</p>
			<p class="text">Examining the crates and boxes in Klarg’s cavern, the group spots the same logo as on the crates they were intended to deliver. Becoming suspicious of Gundren, they interrogate him, where, grateful for the rescue, he reveals that a number of previous shipments have been intercepted on the way to Nashkel. Our heroes conclude that someone else must know of the map, and using Klarg and his band of goblins, has been attempting to capture it for themselves.</p>

			<p class="text">Gundren leads our heroes to an inn at Nashkel where they meet Gundren’s older brothers Tharden and Nundro. Gundren reveals the map, which appears unlike any map either our adventurers or their dwarven patrons have ever seen. Gundren’s brothers are immediately skeptical and accuse Gundren of falling victim to another scam from a halfling named Vinnie, who apparently has a habit of selling Gundren objects purported to be powerful but are useless or dangerous. Tharden, fed up with Gundren’s gullibility, tosses the map to Esmerelda and the three dwarves leave back toward the coast road. Esmerelda immediately recognizes the map as a sigil sequence to a teleportation circle, but with a unique ninth rune.</p>
			<p class="text">Our heroes are awoken to a shadow departing their room at the inn, and Esmerelda immediately notices the map missing from her pack. The group springs into action and finds a group of grey-robed thieves absconding with the map. A fight ensues, but our heroes are unable to stop the thieves. A dwarven paladin staying in the same room assists our heroes. He reveals his name as Deige Stonewall, and appears to know something about the map. Our heroes are deeply skeptical of Deige’s sudden appearance and the fact that he is clearly hiding how much he knows, but it appears, at least for the moment, that they are allies. Deige joins our group and together they track the thieves to the back door of a nearby shop.</p>
			<p class="text">Inside, the group pursues the map down a staircase into a large, hastily-constructed underground laboratory. Esmerelda identifies brewing inside some modification of Potions of Healing, but their precise nature is unclear until the group encounters four animated skeletons that appear soaked in these potions. The adventurers sneak through the lab, discovering more patched-together Klarg-like creatures and accidentally setting off a large explosion due to Noda knocking over a table of chemicals. Deep inside, the heroes discover a pompous, grey-skinned elf with the map in his possession, opening a teleportation circle. The elf identifies himself as the “famous” wizard The Black Spider, and calls in one of his creations, a gigantic sewn-together creature named Patchwork to dispatch our heroes. In the fight, The Black Spider is badly hurt, and abandoning his plan for the moment, disappears through a gateway. Patchwork, absent his master, leaves the fight as well.</p>
			<p class="text">Our heroes retrieve the map abandoned by The Black Spider and complete the teleportation circle, including the unique ninth sigil. Stepping inside, they find a hypostyle chamber with an enormous golden scarab inside. None of the five have ever seen such a thing, but both Deige and Esmerelda immediately agree on who might know: the archmage Zohar at the university at the Candlekeep monestary. Travelling to Candlekeep, Zohar consults with her high cleric companion Astra, then uses the sigil sequence to open a teleportation circle to the scarab chamber. Zohar immediately returns, pale and visibly shaken, and remarks to our adventurers that what they found should not still exist.</p>

			</p>
			
			<p class="text">Zohar and Astra ask our heroes to accompany them to a convening of a council in Baldur’s Gate to determine what is to be done with the discovery of the scarab. On the way, our heroes brief Zohar and Astra on their experiences retrieving the map from The Black Spider. Zohar recognizes the individual described as a former student named Iarno. She describes Iarno as having had not much in the way of potential or talent. Given the abilities he displayed in the fray, particularly in having access to the wand that produced the gateway he escaped through, Zohar worries that Iarno may have obtained a powerful patron. She suggests this may not be the last our heroes have seen of The Black Spider.</p>
			<p class="text">At a hall in the city, upwards of a hundred clerics, wizards, politicians, and guild leaders gather in a council and discuss the discovery. Zohar reveals that she believes both the scarab and the map to be more than a thousand years old and to date from before something she calls The Great Cataclysm. Ignatio, the head of Duff’s order speaks up and asks that the council destroy the scarab for fear that it could be used as a weapon. Duff is immediately suspicious at Ignatio’s behavior. Zohar, having spent her career studying what little survives from before The Great Cataclysm, speaks impassionately about studying the scarab further and requests the appearance of her former colleague, the wizard Has&#807met. Alastair of Waterdeep, the ancient diviner heading the council, agrees with Zohar and charges our heroes with retrieving him from the Oman’s Isle, where he has retired to conduct his research. Has&#807met has guarded the island from teleportation and a maelstrom surrounding the island prevents approach by ship. However, Baldur’s Gate is currently brimming with experimental airships who will in three days be participating in an airship race. Our heroes depart to the wharf to attempt to secure passage with one of the airship captains.</p>
			<p class="text">At the wharf, our heroes are rebuffed by the airship teams one-by-one, until they encounter Nathan Foulweather, a dwarf of Baldur’s Gate, and his haphazardly-constructed airship <i>The Phoenix</i>. Foulweather is in dire need of a crew and offers to transport the group to Oman’s Isle under the condition that they crew for him in the upcoming race and that they are able to finish ahead of the ship captained by Lord Farringwray. Foulweather explains that be designed Farringwray’s ship <i>The Golden Legacy</i>, but was stiffed on the payment. Foulweather cares not about winning the race or its 100,000 GP prize, only about humiliating Farringwray. <i>The Golden Legacy</i> is powered by an arcane core and is incredibly fast, so Foulweather suggests that our heroes sabotage the arcane core so that the ship will explode with a few cannon blasts once in the race.</p>
			<p class="text">Under the cover of night the night before the race, our heroes sneak into Farringwray’s hangar and encounter <i>The Golden Legacy</i>, which is easily ten times the size of Foulweather’s contraption. They sneak aboard through an open porthole and find the arcane core’s chamber. Inside are two guards, one of whom is killed by Noda and the other knocked unconscious by Duff.  Noda damages the arcane core, leaving it vulnerable to further damage and our group sneaks away.</p>
			<p class="text">The following morning, Astra visits to see our heroes off. She explains that she expects the race to be violent and gives the adventurers some parting gifts to see them through the challenge ahead. Our heroes climb aboard <i>The Phoenix</i> and the race begins, the ships catapuled up into the air and out over the ocean. Two competing airships are immediately damaged and fall into the ocean. <i>The Phoenix</i> encounters another airship, whose crew immediately launches an attack. While Hooligan, Noda, and Deige fight off the boarding crew, Esmerelda and Duff critically damage the other ship’s balloons, sending it falling into the ocean below. <i>The Phoenix</i> and her crew fly upwards into the cloud layer, into an approaching winter storm.</p>

			<p class="text">Ascending into the cloud layer, our heroes steel themselves for the coming battles as Nathan Foulweather pilots <i>The Phoenix</i> through the race. As the storm worsens, they encounter another ship, shaped like a batwing with armored balloons. The adventurers dispatch three brigands from the other ship, Deige and Noda pinning one to the ship with pair of javelins. Esmerelda blasts a spellcaster on the opposing ship, leaving the ship with no crew. Deige fouls the other ship’s propeller with vines courtesy of his nature powers, and our heroes fly deeper into the storm, now with twelve opponents remaining.</p>
			<p class="text">Duff helps Foulweather pilot the ship as the storm gets worse, but <i>The Phoenix</i> is soon intercepted by another ship, this one a long rectangle with a bizarre spherical tank at the prow and an enormous arm at the back. As the competing ship pulls alongside, the arm animates and grabs Deige from the deck of <i>The Phoenix</i> and deposits him into the tank, which Deige discovers is full of water and sharks. Deige uses his nature powers to speak with the sharks and heroically rides one out of the top of the tank. Meanwhile, Duff, Noda, and Hooligan find their way onto the opposing ship and begin attacking the crew. Deige makes his way to the hatch to join them, but is grabbed again by the arm and deposited back in the tank. Deige rides a second shark to freedom. Meanwhile, Esmerelda and Steve use their powers to harrass the crew of the other ship, setting fire to its aft section. Duff attempts to steal the tricorn hat work by the other ship’s captain, but flees in a panic when the captain gruesomely removes one of Hooligan’s daggers from his neck. Our heroes successfuly dispatch the other ship’s crew and Noda, discovering the secret of flight, sets the ship into a stall before jumping back aboard <i>The Phoenix</i> with the rest of our heroes, letting the opposing ship crash into the ocean below.</p>
			<p class="text">With Duff back assisting at the helm, <i>The Phoenix</i> continues through the storm and reaches the outer edge of the race route. Foulweather wheels the ship around and begins piloting it back toward Baldur’s Gate. As the storm continues to intensify, our heroes spot an enormous silhouette on the horizon. Foulweather identifies it as Farringwray’s ship, <i>The Golden Legacy</i>. Foulweather approaches the enemy ship from below and behind, lining up the starboard side of <i>The Phoenix</i> with the aft section of <i>The Golden Legacy</i>, aligning <i>The Phoenix</i>’s cannons with the arcane core. Foulweather sends Noda, Hooligan, Esmerelda, and Deige below decks to man the ship’s four cannon on the starboard side. Our heroes begin firing and damage <i>The Golden Legacy</i>, but what should have resulted in a huge explosion of the arcane core does nothing.</p>
			<p class="text">Appearing from atop the massive ship is Farringwray, who shouts down to Foulweather that the vandalism to his arcane core has been found out due to our heroes leaving a guard unconscious during their sabotage mission. Farringwray orders his men to open fire, and dozens of portals open revealing cannon. As <i>The Golden Legacy</i> fires volley after volley, <i>The Phoenix</i> severely damaged. Foulweather, thinking quickly, wheels the ship around, pointing her aft into <i>The Golden Legacy</i>’s port side. He points to a red button on the console and shouts at Duff to press it. Duff slams it home, three portals open on the back of <i>The Phoenix</i>, and dragonfire erupts forth, bathing the side of Farringwray’s ship in fire. Both ships erupt forth from the storm with Baldur’s Gate dead ahead, with <i>The Golden Legacy</i> beginning to pitch downwards from its damage. As <i>The Golden Legacy</i> accelerates downwards, <i>The Phoenix</i>, blasted forward by dragonfire, is pursued by nine other ships. <i>The Golden Legacy</i> slams into the port at Baldur’s Gate, erupting into an enormous wall of fire and arcane energy. Foulweather pilots his battered ship into the flame and bursts forth, landing safely in the city. Our adventurers are greeted as heroes and  having placed first, are awarded the prize of 100,000 GP.  Foulweather, satisfied at the demise of Farringwray, declines his portion and our heroes receive 20,000 GP each, more money than any of them have ever seen or laid hands upon.</p>
			<p class="text">Duff, uninterested in the money, spends a few days distributing it among the poor while Foulweather and the remainder of our heroes patch the airship back together into airworthy shape. Our heroes depart with Foulweather toward Oman’s Isle, and after eight days en route, spot the island and Has&#807met’s laboratory. As another winter storm gathers around the island, Foulweather tells our heroes to hurry, as he can’t keep the ship docked for long.</p>

			<p class="text">While Duff distributes his winnings among the poor, Hooligan is tasked by Zohar and Astra to track down Vinnie the Halfling to interrogate him as to where he obtained the sigil sequence that Gundren purchased and that led to the golden scarab. Meanwhile, Esmerelda and Deige join Nathan Foulweather aboard <i>The Phoenix</i> to retrieve Has&#807met from his ramshackle laboratory on Oman's Isle.</p>
			<p class="text">Inside the lab, a speaker crackles with the voice of Has&#807met, who has been trapped in his quarters by the machines in his lab for the past two weeks. He informs our heroes that he had created a winter wonderland in his laboratory, but no visitors came to experience it. Has&#807met seems skeptical that the fact that his island is almost completely inaccessible has anything to do with the lack of visitors. With all the power routed to the machines in his lab, Has&#807met is trapped in his quarters and needs our heroes to shut off the chambers one-by-one in order to route enough power that he can open the emergency exit. While Foulweather quickly identifies that Has&#807met may not be entirely "with it", the adventurers set off into the laboratory to deactivate it.</p>
			<p class="text">Deige, Esmerelda, and Foulweather proceed from chamber to chamber, deactivating a machine growing and cutting down pine and fir trees at an enormous rate, reorganizing “presents” in a room to make it “fair” and keep the room from tipping side-to-side, and solving a number of “educational” puzzles designed to “entertain” the visiting children. One room contains a clockwork box that identifies itself as “QuizBot, Your Learning Buddy”, which quizzes our heroes on a number of trivia items. Once question asks which generals served at the Battle of Calimport in the year 391, over a thousand years before present and before the Great Cataclysm that Zohar told our heroes of. Absent the correct answer, QuizBot informs our heroes that among the generals who served was an “Esmerelda, protege of Zohar the Magnificent.” Quizbot apologizes for the incorrect data, but quickly vacillates between this Esmerelda being part of the right answer and not before frying in a cloud of smoke. Our heroes, Esmerelda included, are baffled.</p>
			<p class="text">Proceeding deep into the structure. the adventurers locate Has&#807met’s quarters, but his room is guarded by three clockwork robots, two smaller dressed in green and one made up as a rotund elderly bearded man dressed in red that seems obsessed trying to get into Has&#807met’s quarters to ask him what he wants for the winter holiday. A brief fight ensues where our heroes torch the clockwork robots in a wall of flame before rescuing Has&#807met and hightailing it back to Baldur’s Gate.</p>

			<p class="text">With the airship party safely back in Baldur's Gate, Duff returns from distributing his winnings and brings with him from his order's orphanage a new member, a half-elf named Sekmet. While only a teenager, Sekmet is an experienced fighter, and our heroes welcome someone with as much martial prowess as she. Meanwhile, Hooligan has been tasked with following the trail of the map/sigil sequence to the vendor from whom Gundren obtained it: the junk dealer and pawn shop owner Vinnie the Halfling. Upon Hooligan's threats of violence, Vinnie reveals that he is used as a fence by the Cavelli crime family of the city of Athkatla. Unbeknownst to Vinnie, Hooligan, born Antonio, is the runaway scion of the Cavelli clan. Vinnie reveals he was intended to fence the map to someone else, but his greed got the best of him and he offered the map to Gundren for a sizable fee. Vinnie drops the name of Kairon, his contact with the Cavellis. Hooligan reports this information back to the group. With further questions for Vinnie, the group convenes at Vinnie’s shop to find it hastily abandoned. Absent any further clues, our heroes board <i>The Phoenix</i> and depart to Athkatla to track down this Kairon.</p>
			<p class="text">In Athkatla, the beautiful Italianate city to the south, our heroes locate Kairon, a tiefling clearly hiding his identity, and interrogate him. He is reticent to provide much in the way of details, but authenticates the map as the item intended for Vinnie to fence. Kairon offers a deal - in exchange for information about the map, he asks our heroes to break into the vault at The Tiger’s Eye, the casino operated by his employers, and liberate a small box, saying that our heroes will “know it when they see it”. He offers to get the group past the guards and into the vault, but beyond that, the heist will be upon them. Our heroes, using Hooligan’s inside knowledge, locate disguises in the marketplace appropriate to their cover story as an allied crime family, and meet Kairon that night at the casino.</p>
			<p class="text">Kairon breezes the group past the guards and leads them into the vault. Using their cunning, our heroes pop the lock to the most secure section of the vault and see only a small box bathed in a column of light, guarded by a golem. The box’s surface finish perplexes them - it appears not as black, but as <i>nothing</i>. The column of light is discovered to wither anything placed within, but Sekmet dislodges the box from the light, setting off an alarm and awakening the golem guarding it. Duff quickly retrieves the box, experiencing an immediate feeling of absolute dread upon touching it. Guards rush in in response to the alarm, and our heroes fight their way out of the vault with the golem in pursuit. Upon the casino floor, Esmerelda and Steve create a distraction and our heroes quickly disappear into the crowd and out into the marketplace.</p>
			<p class="text">Meeting Kairon back at his bar, Duff surrenders the box, catching a glimpse inside of a jewel glowing and swirling with orange and red light. Kairon is frustrated at the the lack of cleanliness to the heist, but indicates that his client will be pleased. Esmerelda and Sekmet grill Kairon on the map and Kairon reveals that a client came to Michael Cavelli, patron of the Cavelli family, and requested the map be stolen from the restricted section of the library at Candlekeep, then fenced to our heroes’ old adversary The Black Spider / Iarno. The book the map was taken from is inconspicuous and unlabeled but very ancient, and the thief hired to break into Candlekeep left it tucked away at the end of a bookshelf in case anything further was needed by the client. Kairon also indicates that The Black Spider / Iarno has established a base of operations of some sort in the Underdark, and offers to lead our heroes to a known entrance, a famed tavern known as The Yawning Portal.</p>
