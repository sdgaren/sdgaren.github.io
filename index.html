		<h3 id="aboutme">About Me</h3>
		<img class="selfie" src="sam.jpg" alt="Photograph of Samuel Garen"/>
		<p>I am a senior project lead based in Portland, Oregon. At my current position with Epiq Global, I lead programs that help individuals recover damages due to large-scale banking fraud while assisting banks and auditors to identify risks and potential areas of concern, as well as rebuilding my clients' brands and customer confidence in them. Since 2015, the projects I lead have helped and are helping more than two million individuals and businesses worldwide recover over $2 billion USD.</p>
		<p style="margin-bottom: 30px;">I believe that as designers, leaders, and consumers we have an obligation to produce work and consume products that uphold the highest standards of ethics, sustainability, efficiency, long-term utility, and quality. As everything we do consumes resources, our duty is to reduce these demands as much as possible and to produce the most value for the world from what we do consume. I hope that each day my work lives up to these standards.</p>

		<p class="jobtitle">Graduate Teaching Assistant&ensp;&#8226;&ensp;2012&ndash;2014</p>
		<p class="text">At <span class="nohyphens">Portland State University</span>, I acted as an assistant instructor in a series of undergraduate history courses, mostly concentrating on World History and the history of the Middle East. I received the honor from the professors I worked with to offer frequent presentations on the history of the Middle East to students, where I developed a presentation style characterized by bold, graphic typography, meaningful use of animation, and rich, rapid-fire imagery. I also polished skills in providing positive, constructive feedback and critique of ideas, which continues to serve me well.</p>
		<p class="work">Key Achievements</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Presented weekly lectures for undergraduate classes of 60 to 80 students in world history, classical history, and the history of the Middle East. Polished skills in public speaking, instruction, and clear presentation of complex information.</li>
			<li>Held regular discussion and mentoring sessions among students, including constructive critique of writing and analysis skills and techniques.</li>
			<li>Graded assignments, papers, and essays and provided constructive feedback to students.</li>
			<li>Developed reporting methodologies to analyze grade trends across racial, gender, and socio-economic lines to identify po-tential biases in grading and evaluation, as well as core demographics that could be better reached.</li>
			<li>Named Portland State University’s Rockstar Graduate Teaching Assistant for Winter 2012 and Spring 2013.</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="work">Example Work</p>
		<p class="text">The below are examples of PowerPoint slides used for a lecture series I gave, showing the visual style and use of animation I developed as part of my work with Portland State.</p>

To create this animation, I disassembled the beautiful calligraphy of Syed Maaz in Photoshop and created layers that could be animated in Keynote as the brush would have travelled when writing Muhammad's name in Arabic." />
		<img class="slidethumbnail" src="work/psu_gta_03_thumb.jpg" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(3)" alt="After contructing a foundation over a handful of class sessions, this animated title card was used for a crash course on the history of the Islamic faith and the Caliphates, from the death of Muhammad in 632 CE to the Mongol destruction of Baghdad in 1258. This lecture terminated the term and was used to prepare and excite students for the entrypoint that would be used in the following course on the 7th century through to the 15th."/>

Through the use of a Ray Larabie typeface, I wanted students to think not of a stuffy, uptight empire like we sometimes think of, but rather a colorful, noisy, multiculture of dozens of languages and many faiths, a spiderweb of busy trade routes, and packed marketplaces filled with every ware imaginable." />

		<p class="text">Before my college education, I had a career in the Seattle area in the automotive industry, culminating with a position at <span class="nohyphens">The Green Car Company,</span> where I assisted clients with converting their vehicles to run on biodiesel or waste vegetable oil, back when these were yet nascent on the market. GCC was also a pioneer in the electric vehicle and city car industry, and I assisted in the process of importing European and Asian-market vehicles to meet these demands and ensuring they were adequately converted to meet US emissions and safety regulations.</p>
		<p class="work">Key Achievements</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lead a team of four technicians and three auxiliary workers to manage and operate an auto sales and repair facility special-izing in hybrid, biodiesel, and electric vehicles.</li>

		</a>
		<p class="jobtitle">Master's of Arts, History / Architectural History (Unfinished)&ensp;&#8226;&ensp;2012&ndash;2014</p>
		<p class="text">For graduate school, I elected to continue my work in architectural history, focusing upon the use of symbol and motif to communicate across linguistic and religio-cultural lines in the medieval Middle East, with additional focus upon the network of logistics and trade established that provided inspiration and materials which have profoundly influenced the architecture and material culture of the Middle East. Unfortunately, the outbreak of the Syrian civil war and severe damage to the structure that was to be the focus of my thesis has forced me to place further work on hold.</p>

L'Hopital Saint-Louis is a very early example of what would be today recognizable as a hospital, with a concentration on cleanliness and deliberately positioned away from the body of Paris to keep the ill sequestered. As you can observe from the treatment of the background photograph, this was made during the peak of the heavy Instagram filter trend." />

This title card was produced by disassembling the photograph into a number of layers. Text perspective, extrusion, and reflection layers were produced by determining the vanishing points in the photograph with CAD. Multiple text layers to simulate lighting and reflection were produced in Photoshop and animated in Keynote." />

		<h3 id="personalwork">Personal Work</h3>
		<p>I love the act of designing and creating and have taught myself mechanical skills, woodworking, and metal fabrication, as well as CAD, some graphic design skills, and programming in Python and VBa to support my personal interests. Displayed below are a few things I have made or helped make.</p>
		<img class="slidethumbnail" src="work/personal_01_thumb.jpg" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(17)" alt="My friend and studiomate Rana (ranayoung.com) needed a pinhole camera for a project, but wanted to use 35mm film rather than photo paper to allow multiple images without having to unload the camera.

Using information published by the American Foundation for the Blind, I chose to set the cards in 24pt Helvetica, ranged left rather than justified for readability, and using boldly-colored heading backgrounds to help her easily find relevant cards. I also got her a *giant* set of dice." />
